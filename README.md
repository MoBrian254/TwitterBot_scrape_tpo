Description:

A basic example of a Twitter bot using the Tweepy library to search for tweets related to tree planting organizations. 
The bot performs actions such as liking tweets, following users, and scraping tweet information, then outputs the collected data to a JSON file.

Guidelines for Usage:

Twitter Developer Account:

Obtain API keys by creating a Twitter Developer account and setting up a Twitter application. 
Replace 'your_consumer_key', 'your_consumer_secret', 'your_access_token', and 'your_access_token_secret' with your actual API keys.

Install Tweepy:

Ensure you have Tweepy installed. If not, you can install it using:

pip install tweepy

API Rate Limits:

Be aware of Twitter API rate limits to avoid being temporarily blocked. 
Tweepy has some built-in handling for rate limits, but it's essential to be mindful.

Adjust Search Query:

Modify the query variable to suit your specific search criteria. In the example, it is set to "tree planting organization."

Handling Errors:

The code includes a basic error handling mechanism for Tweepy errors. However, you may want to customize it based on your specific needs.

Output File:

The scraped tweet information is stored in a JSON file named 'twitter_results.json.' You can change the filename by modifying the output_file variable.
